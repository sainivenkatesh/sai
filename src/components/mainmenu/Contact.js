        <p  className="para">lorem In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate 
            the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be 
            used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a
             process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without 
             the meaning of the text influencing the design</p>
